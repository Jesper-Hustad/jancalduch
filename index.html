    <h1> Jan Calduch </h1>

    <p> I'm Jan Calduch and I'm an embedded systems designer. I'm originally from Spain, but I've been living in the United States for the past few years. I'm currently enrolled in a Master's program at the University of Southern California. </p>

    <p> I'm passionate about technology and about making things work efficiently and effectively. I love to tinker with electronics and figure out how to make them do what I want them to do. </p>

    <p> In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, traveling, and playing tennis. I'm also a big fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. </p>

    <h2> What is an embedded system? </h2>

    <p> An embedded system is a computer system that is designed to perform a specific task or tasks. Embedded systems are found in a wide range of devices, from cell phones and MP3 players to industrial robots and aircraft. </p>

    <p> Embedded systems are usually designed to be small and efficient, and to use as little power as possible. This is because they are often used in portable devices, or in devices that need to run for a long time without being turned off. </p>

    <p> Embedded systems are often designed to be very reliable, because they are often used in critical applications. For example, an embedded system might be used to control the brakes of a car, or to control the systems of a nuclear power plant. </p>

    <h2> What do embedded systems designers do? </h2>

    <p> Embedded systems designers are responsible for designing and developing the software and hardware for embedded systems. This includes choosing the right microprocessor and designing the circuits that the system will use. </p>

    <p> Embedded systems designers also need to be familiar with the operating systems that are commonly used in embedded systems, such as Linux and RTOS. They also need to know how to develop software in C and C++. </p>

    <p> In addition to their technical skills, embedded systems designers also need to have good problem-solving skills. This is because they often need to debug embedded systems that are not working correctly. </p>

    <h2> How did you get interested in embedded systems design? </h2>

    <p> I've always been interested in technology and in how things work. When I was a kid, I loved taking things apart and figuring out how they worked. I also loved playing with computers and learning to program. </p>

    <p> After I finished high school, I decided to study computer science. But I soon realized that I was more interested in the hardware side of things. So I switched to a degree in electrical engineering. </p>

    <p> During my studies, I did an internship at a company that designs embedded systems. I loved the work, and I decided that I wanted to become an embedded systems designer. </p>

    <h2> What are your goals for the future? </h2>

    <p> My goal is to become a world-renowned embedded systems designer. I want to create systems that are both innovative and reliable. I also want to continue to learn and to keep up with the latest technologies. </p>

    <p> In the future, I also hope to start my own company. I want to create a company that is known for its cutting-edge embedded systems. I also want to create a company that is known for its excellent customer service. </p>
